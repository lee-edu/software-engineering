# Classroom Expectations
My goal is to build an environment where you feel safe and comfortable enough to learn, share your ideas, and make mistakes. We will work together to set classroom norms at the beginning of the year. Treat everyone with respect and have fun!

# Assessments
**Quizzes** are *individual assessments* that will only ever cover what you have done for homework, and what we have done together in class. Quizzes are given *at least once every two weeks.*

**Labs** are *group assessments* that assess whether you can take everything you've learned so far and put it together, often in the format of a longer programming assignment and a corresponding write-up. Labs will be given *at the end of each unit.*

## Retakes and Revisions
We will often have quiz retakes as a class, but individual retakes are also an option. On any given quiz, only your *most recent* attempt will count toward your grade.

Lab revisions are handled on a case-by-case basis.

# Discussions
Readings will be given to supplement the course material. Each reading will include a written response, as well as participation in an in-class discussion. These are graded on a completion basis.

# Academic Honesty
Any submitted work by a student should be their own unless students are collaborating on a group assignment. Collaboration is encouraged. Feel free to talk with other students! However, during these discussions, _do not write down_ any solutions. Students must always note whom they worked with. Failure to do so will result in an integrity penalty.

Any form of cheating will result in a **failing grade** and the student’s advisor will be notified for the first offense. Any subsequent offense will result in the student being asked to speak with their class dean. Forms of cheating include but are not limited to: similar / identical code submitted, solutions submitted that are not a student’s own work.

# Semester Grade
If you complete all the work for this class, you will earn an excellent grade.

  - 90% of your grade will be a product of your work on summative assessments (quizzes, labs, projects).
  - 10% of your grade will be a product of your completion of written discussions and engagement in class discussions.

# Academic Integrity
Collaboration is encouraged -- feel free to work and talk with other students! Always make sure to **cite** the names of who you worked with.

Any form of academic dishonesty is a serious issue, and will be escalated to the student's advisor and grade dean. **I would rather you submit something late than something academically dishonest.** If you are ever unsure, reach out to me! I want to help you succeed in this class.
