# Semester Grade
**Every** graded submission will be assigned a **letter grade**.
  - Quizzes: 50%
  - Labs: 40%
  - Discussions: 10%

# Assessments
**Quizzes** are *individual assessments* that will only ever cover what you have done for homework, and what we have done together in class. Quizzes are given *at least once every two weeks.* Quizzes are sometimes retaken as a class; in this situation, your most recent grade is recorded.

**Labs** are *group assessments* that assess whether you can take everything you've learned so far and put it together, often in the format of a longer programming assignment and a corresponding write-up. Labs will be given *at the end of each unit.* Details will be provided when these assessments are given.

# Discussions
Readings will be given to supplement the course material. Each reading will include a written response, as well as participation in an in-class discussion. These are graded on a completion basis.

# Academic Honesty
Any submitted work by a student should be their own unless students are collaborating on a group assignment. Collaboration is encouraged. Feel free to talk with other students! However, during these discussions, _do not write down_ any solutions. Students must always note whom they worked with. Failure to do so will result in an integrity penalty.

Any form of cheating will result in a **failing grade** and the student’s advisor will be notified for the first offense. Any subsequent offense will result in the student being asked to speak with their class dean. Forms of cheating include but are not limited to: similar / identical code submitted, solutions submitted that are not a student’s own work.
